## General Info
This is an app where we can talk one-on-one or join group chats with others. It's easy to use and lets us have conversations privately or with a bunch of people at the same time.

## Features & Interfaces

1. Login and Signup
- The registration page collects basic user details like name, email, and password and other details. It encrypts the provided password for security. When someone already has an account and clicks "Login," they're taken to a login page where they enter their registered email to access their account.
